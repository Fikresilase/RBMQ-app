# RBMQ-App

A desKtop app built to make my research avalaible for public use

## Features

- **Quantizarion:** to introduce bit redundency with a minimal uality loss.
- **bit reduction:** change the bit deph of evry color pixel from 8 to 5 bit.
- **resverce functionality** to decode and get the orignal image.

## Tech Stack
